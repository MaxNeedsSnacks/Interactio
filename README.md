# Interactio

## This mod has unfortunately been archived for the time being.

The codebase is a mess and was initially created when I didn't know squat about Minecraft's internals, and even after murapix' event system PR I am just... fundamentally unhappy with the design of it. There have been plans for a rework [here](https://maxneedssnacks.notion.site/Interactio-Event-Roadmap-ba86a03111844c6f93f2eda91288eed1), however due to time constraints, fears of feature creep and general burnout those plans never come to be. If you're on 1.18+, I recommend using [Lychee](https://github.com/Snownee/Lychee) instead, and if you're on 1.16, the mod should still for the most part just work:tm:, plus there *may* be maintained forks, or other ways of achieving in-world crafting (I will temporarily unarchive the repository and add those to the README here if applicable)
